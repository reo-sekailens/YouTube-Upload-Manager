# Technical Notes

## Repository facts (verified 2026-08-22)

- Before this scaffold, the repository contained only Git metadata and `.gitattributes`.
- No package manifest, source tree, CI configuration, test runner, or runtime selection exists yet.

## Engineering constraints

- The app is local-first: do not add an application backend, cloud queue, database, object store, analytics service, or automatic media upload outside Google/YouTube.
- Keep Google/YouTube refresh and access tokens out of source control, webview bundles, logs, and memory-bank files. Store them through platform secure storage accessed from Rust. An installed-app OAuth client ID is a public identifier, not a client secret.
- Use PKCE for installed-app OAuth. Desktop may use loopback redirects; Android and iOS must use an approved platform-specific flow because mobile loopback redirects are deprecated.
- Require least-privilege OAuth scopes. Document every requested scope and its product need before implementation.
- Treat upload retries as an idempotency problem. Persist an item identity and provider response before retrying; surface ambiguous outcomes for operator review rather than silently starting a new upload.
- Validate source type, size, and required metadata before queuing. Enforce provider quota and backoff behavior in the execution layer.
- Redact request headers, tokens, local file paths, and sensitive provider payloads from logs and errors shown to operators.
- At import, copy each queued source into an app-managed, device-local workspace and verify its SHA-256 digest. This is the default on every platform so a crash, source-file move, revoked picker handle, or app relaunch never requires the operator to drag the item in again. Desktop “reference in place” may be offered only as an explicitly less-resilient opt-in.
- Persist the encrypted resumable session URI, total length, metadata fingerprint, and provider-confirmed byte range transactionally after every acknowledgment. On launch, query the session using an empty range request; use the returned `308` range or completed response as the sole resume authority. A `404` session expiry or an ambiguous result enters reconciliation and requires a verified match or operator-approved retry; it must not blindly create a potential duplicate.
- Separate local checks from live certification. A real upload canary needs an authorized non-production-safe destination/account and explicit operator approval.

## Scaffolded conventions

- Root `AGENTS.md` defines repository-specific agent guidance.
- `.env.example` contains names and comments only; real environment files are ignored.
- `.codex/instructions.md` supplies a compact AI-agent checklist.
- Pull-request and feature templates prompt for validation and provider/security impact.

## Conventions to establish with implementation

- Add Tauri 2, React + Vite, Rust, SQLite, OS secure-storage integration, formatter, linter, type checking, tests, and CI.
- Record package manager, runtime version, platform build prerequisites, validation commands, signing, and release workflow here when scaffolded.
